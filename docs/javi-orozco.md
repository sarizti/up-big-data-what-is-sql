What is SQL
===========

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. With SQL, users can create, modify, and query databases, as well as perform various operations such as creating tables, inserting and deleting data, and retrieving information.

SQL is a declarative language, which means that users describe what they want to do rather than how to do it. For example, instead of specifying how to retrieve data from a database, the user simply describes the data they want to retrieve and the database system takes care of the task.

SQL is one of the most widely used languages in database administration and is supported by a wide variety of database management systems (DBMS), including MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, among others.

Sql vs. Other Storage Solutions
-------------------------------

There are several data storage solutions to SQL. Some of the most popular alternatives are:

NoSQL: NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a category of data storage solutions characterized by not using the SQL language to access data. Instead, they use other data models, such as documents, graphs, or key-values. Some of the most popular NoSQL databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.
Cloud storage: Cloud storage refers to the ability to store and access data on remote servers over the internet. The most popular cloud storage services are Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure.
In-memory storage: In-memory storage solutions, such as Redis or Memcached, typically store data in the server's RAM, allowing for faster data reads and writes.
File storage: File storage systems, such as Hadoop and Apache Spark, are primarily used for analysis of large volumes of data and are characterized by their ability to process data in parallel.
Real-time storage: Real-time storage systems, such as Apache Kafka, are used to store and process large volumes of data in real time, making them ideal for applications that require real-time event processing.

Sql Commands
------------

There are many SQL commands, but some of the most common are:

SELECT: used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.
INSERT - Used to add new records to a table.
UPDATE – Used to update the values of one or more columns in an existing table.
DELETE: used to delete one or more records from a table.
CREATE – Used to create a new table, view, or stored procedure in a database.
ALTER - Used to modify the structure of an existing table, add or remove columns, or modify constraints.
DROP – Used to drop a table, view, or stored procedure from a database.
JOIN – Used to combine data from two or more related tables in one query.
GROUP BY – Used to group the results of a query based on one or more columns.
ORDER BY: Used to order the results of a query based on one or more columns.
These are just a few examples of the most common SQL commands. There are many other commands and operators available in SQL that allow users to perform a variety of different database management tasks.



Sql Clauses
-----------
SQL clauses are additional commands used in conjunction with main commands (such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) to filter, sort, or group data in a query. Some of the most common SQL clauses are:

WHERE – Used with SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE to filter records based on one or more conditions.
ORDER BY - Used with SELECT to order the results of a query based on one or more columns.
GROUP BY - Used with SELECT to group the results of a query based on one or more columns.
HAVING – Used with GROUP BY to filter the groups of records returned based on one or more conditions.
JOIN – Used with SELECT to combine data from two or more related tables in one query.
DISTINCT - Used with SELECT to remove duplicates from the results of a query.
LIMIT - Used with SELECT to limit the number of records returned by a query.
OFFSET - Used with LIMIT to specify the number of records to skip at the beginning of a query.
IN – Used with SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE to filter records based on a set of values.
BETWEEN – Used with SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE to filter records based on a range of values.
These are just some of the more common SQL clauses. There are many other clauses available that allow users to perform more complex and specific queries in database management.

Other Sql Commands
------------------
SELECT - extracts data from a database.
UPDATE - updates data in a database.
DELETE - deletes data from a database.
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database.
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database.
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database.
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table.
