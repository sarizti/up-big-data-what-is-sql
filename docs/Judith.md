#Introduction 



---

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.

###Uses of SQL
It is used to create, modify, and extract data from databases, and to perform various database management tasks such as creating tables, indexes, and views, as well as defining relationships between tables.

###Comparing SQL with other storage solutions 

1. SQL databases are structured and rely on tables, while NoSQL databases are unstructured and often use document or key-value stores.
1. SQL databases are generally better suited for complex queries and transactions, while NoSQL databases excel at scalability and high-speed data retrieval.
1. SQL databases use structured query language to manipulate data, while NoSQL databases use APIs or programming languages like JavaScript to interact with data.
1. SQL databases are often used in applications that require strong consistency, while NoSQL databases are popular in applications that prioritize availability and partition tolerance.

#SQL commands

An SQL command is a statement that is used to communicate with a relational database management system (RDBMS) and manipulate data stored in the database.

---

### The SELECT Statement

The SELECT command is used to retrieve data from a database table. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, as well as any filtering or sorting criteria. 

Example:
```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```


### The INSERT Statement
 It is used to add new rows of data to a database table. It allows you to specify the values for each column in the new row.


 ```SQL
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

...

### The UPDATE Statement
It allows you to specify the new values for one or more columns, as well as any filtering criteria to identify the rows to be updated.

```SQL
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

...

### The DELETE Statement

The DELETE statement in SQL is used to delete one or more rows from a table.

```SQL
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing';
```

...

Sql Clauses
-----------

### The WHERE Clause

The WHERE clause is used to specify the criteria that rows must meet in order to be included in the query results.

Example:

```SQL
SELECT name FROM users WHERE active=1;
```

### The ORDER BY Clause
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the query results by one or more columns.
...

### The GROUP BY Clause
The GROUP BY clause is used to group the query results by one or more columns.
...

### The LIMIT Clause
The LIMIT clause is used to limit the number of rows returned by the query
...

Other Sql Commands
------------------

### The CREATE TABLE Command

 The CREATE command is used to create a new table, view, index, or other database object.

Example:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE users (
    id int primary key,
    name varchar(255),
    active tinyint
)
```

### The ALTER TABLE Command
The ALTER TABLE command in SQL is used to modify the structure of an existing table. The command allows you to add, modify or remove columns, change the data type of existing columns, add or remove constraints, and more.

Example:

```SQL
ALTER TABLE customers
ADD phone_number VARCHAR(20);

```

...

### The DROP TABLE Command
The DROP TABLE command permanently removes the table and its contents, so it should be used with caution.

Example:

```SQL
DROP TABLE customers;

```
